### About Friends 
There is no specific API key or dedicated API for analyzing the "Friends" TV show. "Friends" is a popular American sitcom, and analyzing it would typically involve watching the episodes and manually extracting information or using natural language processing techniques. I found from omdbapi.com about friends. But knowledges are limited. If you want to see another API example, you can look :
